## Hey ðŸ‘‹, This is Adam J Marcon
<p align='left'>I personally have published a commercial novel and have written several others. Proud to be using my creativity as my unique edge in the world of analytics. Viewing data from a unique perspective and sewing especially well thought out narratives through my presentations to stakeholders. I've completed multiple projects during my time with TripleTen and am proud to say that I not once needed any aid with my work, other than administrative questions. I've remained as independent as possible in utilizing these early projects to sharpen my skills in areas such as SQL, Python, Tableau, and Power BI. I've even started with nothing but raw data and utilized that data to create a full 18-minute presentation including conclusions and suggestions for how the business could proceed more efficiently and effectively. 
I hope my enthusiasm for my work in any field shines through in this summary. Thank you! </p><p align='left'> You can view my resume <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/178wQGPwkbLzNBRP8RH09lBMAwCenFoW1jf279SLCbm0/edit?usp=sharing ' target=_blank><u>here</u>.</a></p>
