## Hey ðŸ‘‹, This is Adam J Marcon
<p align='left'>I'm a Business Intelligence Analyst with over three years experience in remote sales and content writing. I've also personally published a commercial novel and written several others. Proud to be using my creativity as my unique edge in the world of analytics. I'm highly skilled in necessary tech stacks such as G-Suite, SQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau, and Loom. Capable of translating complex data sets into concise and comprehensive presentations, and helping stakehodlers make data driven decisions.  
I hope my enthusiasm for my work shines through in this summary. Thank you! </p><p align='left'> You can view my resume <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/178wQGPwkbLzNBRP8RH09lBMAwCenFoW1jf279SLCbm0/edit?usp=sharing ' target=_blank><u>here</u>.</a></p>
